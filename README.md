# RISCV-Custom-ISA-Verilog-Processor
LLVM Backend and Verilog Core for Custom RV32I ISA. Integrated specialized instructions for compute and memory operations. The extended LLVM toolchain compiles C code using the custom ISA, which is then run on a multi-stage, performance-optimized Verilog processor.
